            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Object Dodge is a Unity game that challenges players to survive as long as possible by dodging 
                incoming objects. The game includes smooth controls, increasing difficulty over time, and a leaderboard 
                to encourage competition. This project demonstrates my ability to work with Unity, C#, and game physics.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p>
                The Object Dodge project was developed to enhance my Unity game development skills. Here are the key 
                areas of focus during the development process:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Controls:</strong> Implementing smooth and responsive controls for dodging obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Obstacle Generation:</strong> Creating a random obstacle spawning system with increasing difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Physics:</strong> Using Unity's physics engine to create realistic object behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> Developing a local leaderboard system to store high scores.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
