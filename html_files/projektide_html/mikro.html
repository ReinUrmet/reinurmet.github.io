            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Mikro is a 2D sidescroller game built using Python and Pygame. In this game, players control a character 
                named Mikro as they navigate through different levels, avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies using unique mechanics. 
                This project demonstrates my understanding of game loops, animations, and event-driven programming.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p>
                The Mikro project helped me develop skills in game design and implementation. Key areas of focus included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Physics:</strong> Implementing realistic player movement, gravity, and collision detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemy AI:</strong> Designing basic enemy behavior to create engaging gameplay challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics and Animations:</strong> Creating smooth character animations and a visually appealing environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Managing user inputs for movement and interaction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                Building Mikro gave me practical experience in game development and programming. Here's what I learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to create a game loop to handle updates, rendering, and events efficiently.</li>
                <li>Enhanced my understanding of Pygame’s features, including surface blitting and sprite handling.</li>
                <li>Improved problem-solving skills while debugging collision issues and implementing level transitions.</li>
                <li>Learned how to optimize performance for smoother gameplay on different devices.</li>
            </ul>
