            <p>
                This project was created as part of a school assignment to develop a web-based version of the classic game 
                Minesweeper. The game features an interactive grid, multiple difficulty levels, and responsive design for
                desktop and mobile users.

            <p>
                Through this project, I enhanced my skills in several areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basics of HTMl:</strong> Since this was one of the first websites I made, it was a good introduction to HTML</li>
                <li><strong>Basics of CSS:</strong> Learned about the basics of color theory, how to use css, how to position elements and basically most things about css</li>
                <li><strong>Basics of Javascript:</strong> Me and my friend created the game in javascript which was a real challange, my friend had done javascript before so we got it done thanks to his help, but I leartned the basics of javascript with this</li>
            </ul>
