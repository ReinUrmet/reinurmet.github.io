                This project was created as part of a school assignment to develop a web-based version of the classic game 
                Minesweeper. The game features an interactive grid, multiple difficulty levels, and responsive design for
                desktop and mobile users.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p>
                The Minesweeper website project aimed to improve my skills in front-end development and game logic implementation.
                Key areas of focus included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Grid:</strong> Generating grids of varying sizes based on difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Logic:</strong> Implementing the logic for uncovering cells, handling bombs, and calculating adjacent mines.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the game works seamlessly across devices.</li>
            </ul>
