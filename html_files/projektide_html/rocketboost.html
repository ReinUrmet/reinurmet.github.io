            <p>
                Rocket Boost is an exciting game development project where I focused on creating a futuristic environment
                and interactive gameplay mechanics. The game involves controlling a rocket through challenging levels
                in a visually stunning sci-fi world.

            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p>
                Rocket Boost was developed to push the boundaries of what I could achieve in game design. It combines
                engaging mechanics, smooth animations, and an immersive world. Here’s what I focused on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level Design:</strong> Creating a balance between challenge and fun.</li>
                <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Implementing realistic physics for the rocket movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Aesthetics:</strong> Designing a futuristic world with attention to detail.</li>
            </ul>
